'''
write a function called 'slur' with the parameters: canvas, time, duration, control1, control2, width. 'canvas' is the tkinter canvas where the function draws a slur. 'time' is the x axis startingpoint of the slur. 'duration' is the 'time+duration' x axis from the slur. so 'duration' gives the endpoint of the slur. 'control1' and 'control2' are essentially the bezier curve control points 1 and 2.
