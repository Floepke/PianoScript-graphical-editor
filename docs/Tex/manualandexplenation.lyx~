\begin_layout Section*
Introduction; what is PianoScript and why?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PianoScript is a music notation for pianists that like to read music in
 a visual and practical way.
 It aimes to be a tool and can be extended as full replacement but that
 is not the goal of the project.
 The main goal is to provide a tool that plots the rhythm and harmony of
 a midifile in a readable design.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PianoScript is based/inspired by an almost hundred year old music notation
 called 'Klavarskribo'.
 There are a small number of eye-catching visual differences that make PianoScri
pt a different music notation.
 Besides that PianoScript is only aiming for piano music/players in its
 current design so the user can learn and practice the music from this printed
 plot.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main reason PianoScript was born is that Philip Bergwerf discovered
 Klavarskribo and begun searching for improvements and different possibillities
 in terms of visual design as well practical readabillity of the notation
 itself.
 In this process, Philip formed the idea of plotting a midifile over the
 klavarskribo staff in the form of grey midi-notes.

PianoScript Music Notation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Basic system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PianoScript can be read from left to right or from top to bottom.
 The reader can choose to read horizontal or vertical.
 The advantage of reading vertical is that the orientation of the notation
 is the same as the orientation of the instrument you are playing.
 For extra clarity we only explain everything in the horizontal orientation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Pitch
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pitch is expressed on a twelve tone staff.
 As you can see on the first page of this document, the staff exists from
 groups of two and three line that are connected to a miniature pianokeyboard(on
ly on the first line of a music document) and thus, are the black keys.

\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notes are black or white depending on the color of the pianokey.
 This means that all black notes are on top of a staff-line while all white
 notes are in between or against a staff-line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The staff is at least as large as the range of the music.
 A rule is that the dashed lines are always visible because it's the clef.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Clef
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The clef is represented as a group of two c

lines.
 We call them 
\series bold
\emph on
the central lines
\series default
\emph default
.
 They give the position of the central-c; the c that is in front of you
 in the middle of the piano keyboard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can read the right octave relative to the central lines.
 The central lines are always visible.
 An empty measure shows only the clef
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Rhythm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rhythm is expressed in distance like in a pianoroll editor or inside 'Synthesia'
 youtube videos.

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\emph{\small picture 2: the first bar of the moonlight sonata}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This example bar is written in 
\bar under
4/4 time-signature
\bar default
.
 We divide the length of the bar in four equal pieces and thus every 'grid
 space' is one 
\bar under
quarter
\bar default
 note long.
 We call this the 
\emph on
\bar under
base-grid
\emph default
\bar default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we follow the logic of relatively reading the rhythm: There are two notes
 with a duration of a 
\bar under
quarter
\bar default
 note(four quarters/grid spaces).
 The grouped notes on the right side are all a equal length.
 There fit three notes in a quarter grid space so these are 
\bar under
quarter triplets
\bar default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The stem of the note is used to point out the exact point in time the note
 starts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Optionally we can group notes to give an overview of the rhythmic information
 using a beam.
 A beam looks like a eight-beamed beam from the traditional music notation
 but has nothing to do with length.
 Usually we group all notes that are inside the base-grid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Hand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can read for which hand the note is written in two ways: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The left hand notes do have a tiny dot inside the note.
 The right hand notes don't have a dot inside the note.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the stem points down the hand is left.
 If the stem points up the hand is right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Ornaments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Roughly there are two types of notes: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
normal notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ornament or decoration notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the traditional music notation there are many symbols that represent
 all kinds of ornaments.
 Because PianoScript is a performance notation(it's basically a midi-file
 representaion suitable for printing and reading on a piece of paper), the
 best way to write ornaments is to write them out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make clear we are writing an ornament, we write ornaments without a stem.
 Ornaments are in general meant like a roughly timed note or group of notes;
 it leaves a lot of interpretation for the pianist.
 Therefore it doesn't bother if the rhythmic notation is less clear because
 of the abcense of the stem, it still gives a clear guideline on how to
 play the ornament.
