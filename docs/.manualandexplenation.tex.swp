\section*{Introduction; what is it and why?}
PianoScript is a music notation for pianists that like to read music in a visual and practical way. It aimes to be a tool and can be extended as full replacement but that is certainly not the goal of the project. The main goal is to provide a tool that plots the rhythm and harmony of a midifile in a readable design.\\

PianoScript is based/inspired by an almost hundred year old music notation called 'Klavarskribo'. There are a small number of eye-catching visual differences that make PianoScript a different music notation. Besides that PianoScript is only aiming for piano music/players in its current design so the user can learn and practice the music from this printed plot.\\

The main reason PianoScript was born is that Philip Bergwerf discovered Klavarskribo and begun searching for improvements and different possibillities in terms of visual design as well practical readabillity of the notation itself.\\


The document has two parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tutorial of the PianoScript music notation; We explain the music notation in detail.
\item Manual for PianoScript software; To be able to use the notation there is a piece of software called PianoScript. In this part we explain the software in detail.
\end{itemize}

You can use the four-bar example of the Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven to refer to while reading the document.

\part{PianoScript Music Notation}
\section*{Basics}
PianoScript in short is a pianoroll in a readable design as music notation. The notation includes of course a lot of elements. We start with the basics:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\subsubsection*{Notes} 
Pitch is expressed on a twelve tone staff. As you can see on the first page of this document, the staff exists from groups of two and three line that are connected to a miniature pianokeyboard(only on the first line of a music document) and thus, are the black keys.

\begin{center}

\[

\]

The notes are black or white depending on the color of the pianokey. This means that all black notes are on top of a staff-line while all white notes are in between or against a staff-line.

\subsubsection*{Rhythm}

Rhythm is expressed in distance like in a pianoroll editor or inside 'Synthesia' youtube videos.

\begin{center}

\end{center}
\[
\emph{\small picture 2: the first bar of the moonlight sonata} 
\]

This example bar is written in 4/4 time-signature. We divide the length of the bar in four equal pieces and thus every 'grid space' is one \underline{quarter} note long. 

If we follow the logic of relatively reading the rhythm: There are two notes with a duration of a \underline{whole} note(four quarters/grid spaces). The grouped notes on the right side are all a equal length. There fit three notes in a quarter grid space so these are \underline{quarter triplets}.

\item{\emph{Clef}}
\item{\emph{Hand} (for which hand the note is written)}
\end{itemize}
